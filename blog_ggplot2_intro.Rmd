No matter what level of R Programmer you are, you likely struggle to remember every single intricate detail required by ggplot2. It has a steep learning curve compared to base R's plotting functions, but once you learn to use it, it can produce production level graphics. This post will serve as a quick reference guide to ggplot2. The idea is that it can quickly give an example of the code and output for each type of plot you might need.

Ugly Plot
```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Pretty Plot
```{r fig.height=4, fig.width=8}
library(ggplot2)
qplot(data=cars,x=speed,y=dist,geom="point")
```
