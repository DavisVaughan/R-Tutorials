No matter what level of R Programmer you are, you likely struggle to remember every single intricate detail required by ggplot2. It has a steep learning curve compared to base R's plotting functions, but once you learn to use it, it can produce production level graphics. This post will serve as a quick reference guide to ggplot2. The idea is that it can quickly give an example of the code and output for each type of plot you might need.

<h1>Scatter Plots</h1>

I often need scatter plots to show relationships between data. Let's look at a quick example of the benefits of ggplot vs base R.

__Ugly Plot__
```{r}
plot(cars)
```


__Pretty Plot__
```{r fig.height=4, fig.width=10}
library(ggplot2)
qplot(data=cars,x=speed,y=dist,geom="line")
```
